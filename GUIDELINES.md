# Attitude

We are a mission critical data storage tool and people 
depend on us shouldn't be let down. Fun is still allowed.

# Programming

All rust code is run through rustfmt + clippy.

Try to follow rust community guidelines.

Keep the data write path as small as possible.

Focus on allowing data pipelining where latency may be an issue.

# Security

Be wary of making copies of secret key material.

# Testing

Keep the data write path 100 percent tested. This includes error paths.

# Git

Try to keep commit messages capitalized proper sentences.
If this is a problem, work in a branch until something describable is done.

# Documentation

Documentation priority:

1. Persistent state (disk, sqlite schemas) documented.
2. Network communications documented.
3. Top level design.
4. Crate/library/software interfaces.
5. Code.
